# holiday-manager

This file contains a holiday manager app. The app loads data from a JSON and scrapes data off the web to create a list of holiday dates and names. Users can edit this list, adding and removing dates of their own. Users can also view a list of holidays in a given week, including a list of dates and weather forecasts for holidays in the next week.

Here is a list of files in the repository:

-index.py - This file contains the main python code for the project.

-holidays.json - This file contains a JSON file with holiday data to be loaded into the program.

-.gitignore - This .gitignore tells the repository not to push output JSON save-files generated by the program.

-plan folder

  -plan.txt - This text file contains pseudocode and planning from the development of the app.
